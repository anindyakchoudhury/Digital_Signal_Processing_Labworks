## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Study of Sampling, Quantization, and Encoding
This experiment explored the fundamentals of analog-to-digital conversion. We implemented sampling of continuous signals at different rates, quantized the sampled signals with varying bit depths, and analyzed the effects of quantization on signal quality through SQNR (Signal-to-Quantization Noise Ratio) measurements.

### Experiment 2: Time Domain Analysis of Discrete Time Signals and Systems
In this experiment, we investigated various time-domain properties of discrete signals and systems. We worked with basic sequence generation, linear time-invariant system responses using convolution and difference equations, and explored the application of correlation in signal detection and system identification.

### Experiment 3: Z-Transform and Its Applications
This experiment focused on the Z-transform and its applications in digital signal processing. We implemented Z-transform operations, explored inverse Z-transform techniques, analyzed pole-zero plots for different systems, and studied system stability and causality conditions. We also implemented the Sch√ºr-Cohn stability test for higher-order systems.

### Experiment 4 (Part 1): Frequency Domain Analysis of DT Signals and Systems
This experiment explored the frequency domain representation of discrete-time signals, including Discrete-Time Fourier Series (DTFS), Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT), and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). We analyzed the effects of sampling, windowing, and zero-padding on spectral estimation and studied frequency resolution limitations.

### Experiment 4 (Part 2): DFT Applications
In this part, we implemented various applications of DFT such as linear and circular convolutions, correlation estimation, and frequency analysis. We also studied modulation, demodulation, and frequency-division multiplexing applications.

### Experiment 5: FIR Filter Design
The final experiment focused on Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design techniques. We implemented filter design using window methods (Rectangular, Bartlett, Hanning, Hamming, Blackman, and Kaiser) and the Parks-McClellan algorithm. We analyzed the trade-offs between various design parameters such as filter order, transition bandwidth, and ripple.
